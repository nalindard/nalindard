<summary>Neon Thoughts</summary>

*When the night stretches on without end, </br>
    And the stars are hidden from your sight, </br>
    You create a world with your mind's pen, </br>
    Where anything is possible and bright !* </br>

  *But the frozen thoughts explode in your mind, </br>
    Like fireworks of doubt and fear, </br>
    You wonder if you'll ever find, </br>
    A light to guide you through the infinite unclear !* </br>

  *Is this all a dream or a nightmare? </br>
    Or the reality of your own existence? </br>
    Are you alone or is someone there? </br>
    Do you have a choice or a destiny to follow hence?* </br>
